        At age 12, Laurie Ferger encountered the bestselling computer of all times, the Commodore 64.  
        Back then, magazines published code that you could type to create games.  Thus, a passion for programming was ignited.

        In college she majored in mathematics, and took numerous early programming classes including Logo, Basic, C and Pascal.  
        She was often the only female member of the class.  

        Her first job was teaching computer skills to k-12 students as a full-time teacher at Hamilton Central Schools. 
        She left Hamilton for a career writing software for fashion designers and learned how to weave and create patterns 
        based on mathematics.  Her work for the advertising agency, Mark Russell and Associates, expanded her skills to web 
        programming for large firms like ADT.   After programming for the web became her focus, she started her own 
        business and is currently running it, as well as teaching SQL Database, Python programming and Front End Web 
        Development at Syracuse University.  
 
        When Laurie is not at work you can find her singing with the Syracuse Opera or riding her bike.
