	At age 12, Laurie Ferger encountered the bestselling computer of all times, the Commodore 64. 
	Back then magazines published code that you could type in to create games.
	Thus, a passion for programming was ignited.  
	In college she majored in mathematics, and took numerous early programming classes including
	Logo, Basic, C and Pascal.  She was often the only female member of the class.  Her fist job was 
	teaching computer skills to K-12 students as a full-time teacher at Hamilton Central Schools.  
	She left Hamilton  for a career writing software for fashion designers and learned how to weave and create
	patters based on mathematics.
