		At age 12, Laurie Ferger encountered the bestselling computer of all times, the Commodore 64. 
		Back then magazines published code that you could type in to create games.
		Thus, a passion for programming was ignited.  </p><p>
		In college she majored in mathematics, and took numerous early programming classes including
		Logo, Basic, C and Pascal.  She was often the only female member of the class.  Her fist job was 
		teaching computer skills to K-12 students as a full-time teacher at Hamilton Central Schools.  
		She left Hamilton  for a career writing software for fashion designers and learned how to weave and create
		patters based on mathematics.  </p>
